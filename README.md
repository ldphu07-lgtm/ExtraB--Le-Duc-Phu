## 1. Project Overview
This project is a multipage static website designed to showcase my personal portfolio. It demonstrates the application of HTML5 and CSS3 best practices, focusing on information architecture, visual hierarchy, and responsive design without the use of JavaScript.

## 2. File Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **Root Directory:**
  - `index.html`: The homepage featuring a hero section and a brief introduction.
  - `about.html`: Detailed biography, profile image, and key skills.
  - `projects.html`: A gallery of past projects displayed in a grid layout.
  - `contact.html`: Contact information and a mock-up contact form.
  - `README.md`: Project documentation.

- **Assets Directory (`/assets`):**
  - `css/styles.css`: The single external stylesheet managing the layout, typography, and responsive rules for all pages.
  - `images/`: Contains all visual assets (profile picture, project screenshots, etc.).

## 3. Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. It uses CSS Grid for the project gallery and Flexbox for the navigation bar.
- **Unified Navigation:** Consistent navigation bar across all pages with an **"Active State"** indicator to show the user's current location.
- **CSS Variables:** Utilized `:root` variables for consistent color management and easy theming.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** The navigation menu transforms from a horizontal row (Desktop) to a vertical column (Mobile) for better usability on small screens.

## 4. Installation & Testing Instructions

### How to Run
1. Download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
3. Navigate through the site using the menu links.

### How to Test Responsiveness
1. Open the website in Google Chrome.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** (or press `F12`).
3. Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`).
4. Select different devices (e.g., iPhone SE, iPad Air) or drag the viewport edges to verify that the layout adjusts correctly without breaking.
